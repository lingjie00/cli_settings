# vim settings
Vim is fun, saves me tons of time moving between keyboard and mouse.

Vim is more fun when I have some handy add ons.

zsh is good, more fun than bash. Remember to install Oh My Zsh, makes zsh even better.

```
https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This repo stores the vim settings and zsh settings I use.
